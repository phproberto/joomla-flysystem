## Description. <a id="description"></a>

This is a way to provide an extendable system to easily access, from Joomla, files stored anywhere (Dropbox, AWS, and any existing adapter that exists or that you want to create). 

### Installation. <a id="installation"></a>

This repository does not contain a joomla installable package. It's the main source of the code used by a library that I will distribute as soon as a stable version is released.

### Documentation. <a id="documentation"></a>

I've created a nice [Documentation](https://phproberto.github.io/joomla-flysystem) with a lot of information to understand what is this and how to use it.

## Requirements <a id="requirements"></a>

* PHP 7.0+ or higher
* Joomla! 3.8.1 or higher

## Copyright & License <a id="license"></a>

This library is licensed under [MIT LICENSE](./LICENSE).
